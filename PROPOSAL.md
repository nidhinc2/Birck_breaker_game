  I want to make the game : 'Brick Breaker'.

  Goals for the first week : I aim to just implement the brick on the cinder screen, a paddle that moves according to user control, and a ball that
  starts from a defined origin on the paddle and moves upwards.

  In the second week, I want to fully implement functionality. I want to implement the ball colliding with the bricks and bouncing back and according to where it collides with the paddle, again moving up and colliding with another brick. Every collision with a brick adds points. Once all bricks are destroyed, the player wins.

  In the third week, I want to add even more functionality. I can add angles at which the player can release the ball. (1 being the leftmost angle, and
  5 being the rightmost angle). The ball will hit the brick based on the angle selected. I would also like to add some power ups that can be used.

* how to set it up and run it

  /*
  First, I want to implement the bircks on the screen with long rectangular strips of bricks
  and create a ball class to draw a ball on a brick.
  Then create velocities for the ball so that it moves up and down.

  For the second week, I will add points to the game. As the ball collides with brick, the player gains points and if the player gains enough points, the bricks start getting destroyed.

  For the third week, I will create different types of bricks (some give more points) and also create different angles at which the player can release the ball. I will also try add some power ups.
