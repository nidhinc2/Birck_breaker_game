## Project title
Brick Breaker

## Introduction
This project is written using c++ and uses a free library in C++ called Cinder.
Welcome to Brick Breaker!
This is an attempt to re create the orignial Birck Breaker game. There is a ball on a paddle. You have to break bricks as the ball collides against the paddle. At the beginning, you choose an angle from
1 to 5 (1 being the leftmost and 5 being the rightmost). The ball once released, should be kept within the game window by moving the paddle.
There are 4 power ups at different location:
1) the blue power up : increases the speed of the ball.
2) the pink power up : increases the length of the paddle.
3) the white power up that increases the size of the ball.
4) the brown power up that moves the paddle lower.
Once all bricks are destroyed, the game is won.
